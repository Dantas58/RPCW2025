Also commonly referred to as Eurochart Top 100 Albums, the chart showcased the sales of an act in 19 European countries based on IFPI data. The European Top 100 combined album sales (both retail and digital) of new and older albums. The methodology was different from the US Billboard 200, where albums would only be allowed to chart if they weren't 18 months old. If an album older than 18 months had enough sales to enter the 200 chart after having already dropped out of the 100th position, it would chart on The U.S. Billboard Catalog Albums. Later Billboard reviewed the criteria and decided the older albums would also be allowed to chart in the 200, as it should show what's being sold. The chart update and issue dating followed the rules of the Billboard 200: sales tracking week began on Monday and ended on Sunday. A new chart was published the following Thursday with an issue date of the following Saturday. The first Eurochart number one album was Thriller by Michael Jackson. The final chart was published on 11 December 2010, following the news of Billboard closing their London office and letting their UK-based staff go. The album with the longest stay at number one was Madonna's True Blue, with 34 weeks. The last number one album on the chart was Progress by Take That.",

Starring Kim Basinger, Gabriel Byrne and Brad Pitt, it tells the story of a cartoonist who finds himself in the animated world he thinks he created, but has actually existed long before. In this world, he is seduced by one of the characters, a femme fatale who wants to become human. Following the success of Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988) and his own professional resurgence in television in the late 1980s, Bakshi conceived the film as a live-action/animated horror film. He brought the idea to Paramount Pictures, and became attached to direct; it was his first feature film in nearly a decade. The film was intended as his comeback, however, interference from producer Frank Mancuso Jr. led to an extensive rewrite from and an uncredited Larry Gross changing the film from adult-oriented horror to more of an adolescent comedy-fantasy. As a result, relations between Bakshi, Mancuso, and the studio deteriorated, and the film had a highly tumultuous production. Cool World was released by Paramount on July 10, 1992. Upon its release, the film was a critical and commercial failure. Critics panned the film for its story, acting, animation, and effects combining animation with the live-action footage; however, the soundtrack and visuals received praise. The film was also a box office bomb, grossing $14 million against a budget of $28 million. Despite appearing on several lists of the worst films ever made, Cool World developed a cult following and has been described as a cult classic.",

The show usually satirizes contemporary American popular culture and politics. SNL features a two-tiered cast: the repertory members, also known as the \"Not Ready for Prime-Time Players\", and newer cast members, known as \"Featured Players.\" A typical episode of SNL will feature a single host, who delivers the opening monologue and performs in sketches with the cast. While the format also features a musical guest, and a number of episodes have featured celebrity cameos, the focus of the show is the guest host. George Carlin was the first to host the show, while Candice Bergen was the first woman to do so. Guests that host five times (or more) are considered \"members\" of the Five-Timers Club, introduced on the December 8, 1990, episode, when Tom Hanks became the seventh person to host their fifth episode. There have been 44 episodes on which the show's host also served as the musical guest, with the most recent being Jack Harlow on October 29, 2022. The first to pull double duty was Paul Simon on October 18, 1975. The Rolling Stones are the only band to ever serve as both host and musical guest during the same episode, which aired October 7, 1978.",

The area was originally part of area code 415, one of the first three area codes created in California in 1947, which originally covered all of central California. In 1991, area code 510 was created to encompass most of the East Bay. Area code 925 was created March 14, 1998, when area code 510 was split along the natural border of the Berkeley Hills. The area code includes southeastern Alameda County (Dublin, Pleasanton, Livermore, Sunol, and unincorporated areas surrounding those communities), and all of Contra Costa County except the western part (El Cerrito to Crockett). Prior to October 2021, area code 925 had telephone numbers assigned for the central office code 988. In 2020, 988 was designated nationwide as a dialing code for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, which created a conflict for exchanges that permit seven-digit dialing. The area code was therefore transitioned to ten-digit dialing on October 24, 2021.",
